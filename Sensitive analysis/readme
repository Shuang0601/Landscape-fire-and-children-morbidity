To ensure the robustness of the results, the following sensitivity analyses were performed:
1) placing the knots for natural cubic spline of LFS PM2.5 at 10th and 90th or 20th and 80th centiles of the mean exposure distribution.
2) changing the df for meteorological variables: temperature from 4 to 3 and 5, RH from 3 to 4 and 5. 
3) changing df for time trends from 7 to 8 and 9.
